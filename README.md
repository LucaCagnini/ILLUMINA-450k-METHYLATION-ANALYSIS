## Overview

This repository features a complete pipeline for analyzing Illumina 450K methylation data using R. The pipeline includes preprocessing (with the preprocessNoob method), quality control, normalization, statistical analysis (using  Mann-Whitney U test and P-value threshold of 0.05), principal component analysis (PCA), and the identification of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between control (CTRL) and disease (DIS) samples. This works is the final project of Group 5 for the DNA/RNA Dynamics course (MSc in Bioinformatics, University of Bologna, a.y. 2024/2025).

## Requirements
The project was performed using R and Rstudio, analysing data from the platform Illumina HumanMethylation450k (input_data). Necessary packages were installed in our R enviroment:

```r
install.packages(minfi)
install.packages(ggplot2)
install.packages(nitr)
install.packages(BiocManager)
install.packages(factoextra)
install.packages(cluster)
install.packages(qqman)
install.packages(gplots)
```


# Project Workflow

This document outlines the step-by-step workflow of our DNA/RNA methylation project, comparing CTRL and DIS sample groups using Illumina microarray data.

---

## 1. Data Preparation and Import
- Install and load required R packages: `minfi`, `BiocManager`, `knitr`.
- Clean the R environment and set the working directory.
- Load the sample sheet using `read.metharray.sheet()` to import metadata.
- Read raw data using `read.metharray.exp()` to generate the `RGset` object.

---

## 2. Signal Extraction
- Extract fluorescence intensity data for Red (Cy5) and Green (Cy3) channels from `RGset` using `getRed()` and `getGreen()`.
- Store the data into two separate dataframes: `Red` and `Green`.

---

## 3. Quality Control
- Classify sample quality based on the percentage of failed probes:
  - **High quality**: < 0.01%
  - **Good quality**: < 0.2%
  - **Low quality**: > 0.2%
  - **Critical quality**: around 1% (may require exclusion)

---

## 4. Beta and M Value Calculation
- Split samples into CTRL and DIS groups using metadata.
- Create `MSet.raw` objects for each group.
- Compute **Beta values** with `getBeta()` and **M values** with  `getM()`.
- Calculate and plot mean methylation values for both groups.
- Normalise data and asses the quality of normalisation. 

---
## 5. Normalization and Batch Effect Analysis
- Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess batch effects (e.g., by `Sentrix_ID`).
- PCA suggested that normalization did not fully correct batch effects.

---

## 6. Statistical Analysis
- Perform Mann whitney U test for each probe comparing CTRL vs DIS.
- Create a dataframe containing p-values.
- Filter probes with p ≤ 0.05 for significance.
- Plot the distribution of p-values.

---

## 7. Visualization
- Generate a **heatmap** using the top 100 most significant probes.
- Apply **hierarchical clustering**.
